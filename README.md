# css-poster
Poster layout made in CSS

This is an actual class project; had a team presentation to go with it and the whole nine yards.

Under the hood it's very janky, but it gave me a playground to experiment with CSS grid tools and general layout.

You can see a rendered version of the poster in the PDF file.
